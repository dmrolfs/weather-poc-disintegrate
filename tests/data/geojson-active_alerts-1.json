For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking\nwaves of 7 to 9 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards\nStatement, a high risk of rip currents.\n\n* WHERE...Accomack County.\n\n* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 1 AM EDT\nThursday. For the High Surf Advisory, until 2 AM EDT Thursday.\nFor the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Shallow flooding is expected in the most vulnerable\nlocations near the waterfront and shoreline resulting in a low\nthreat of property damage. Expect up to one foot of water above\nground level in low lying, vulnerable areas. Some roads and low\nlying property including parking lots, parks and lawns near the\nwaterfront will experience shallow flooding. Dangerous swimming\nand surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Large\nbreaking waves of 7 to 9 ft will result in dangerous surf\nconditions. Do not enter or approach the water due to the risk\nof being swept away.",

Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone\nproperty.\n\nInexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to\ndangerous surf conditions.\n\nLife-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain\ncalm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,\nfloat or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to\nescape, face the shore and call or wave for help.\n\nShore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is\nextremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you\nare in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at\nall times.\n\nStrong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip\ncurrents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many\ncases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers\nfrom being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it\ndifficult to return to shore.",

For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking\nwaves of 6 to 8 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards\nStatement, a high risk of rip currents.\n\n* WHERE...Maryland Beaches County.\n\n* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 10 PM EDT this\nevening. For the High Surf Advisory, until 2 AM EDT Thursday.\nFor the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Shallow flooding is expected in the most vulnerable\nlocations near the waterfront and shoreline resulting in a low\nthreat of property damage. Expect up to one foot of water above\nground level in low lying, vulnerable areas. Some roads and low\nlying property including parking lots, parks and lawns near the\nwaterfront will experience shallow flooding. Dangerous swimming\nand surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Large\nbreaking waves of 6 to 8 ft will result in dangerous surf\nconditions. Do not enter or approach the water due to the risk\nof being swept away.",
                "instruction": "If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be\nclosed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of\nunknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone\nproperty.\n\nInexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to\ndangerous surf conditions.\n\nLife-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain\ncalm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,\nfloat or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to\nescape, face the shore and call or wave for help.\n\nShore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is\nextremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you\nare in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at\nall times.\n\nStrong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip\ncurrents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many\ncases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers\nfrom being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it\ndifficult to return to shore.",

The air quality\nalert is in effect now until 8 PM on Wednesday, September 27, 2023.\n\nElevated levels of ozone  the predominant summertime pollutant\nare likely to result in poor air quality in the afternoon and early-\nevening hours. Ozone air pollution can cause respiratory health\nproblems, including trouble breathing, asthma attacks, and lung\ndamage. Children, older adults, and people with asthma or COPD may\nbe more sensitive to the health effects of ozone.\n\nAir quality can change depending on time of day and weather\nconditions. Increased emissions of chemicals and faster ozone\nformation rates due to heat, along with low winds and stagnant\nweather can cause unusually high and persistent levels of ozone\npollution.\n\nTo help minimize ozone air pollution levels:\nLimit the use of gasoline powered lawn and garden equipment until\nevening hours\nConserve electricity and set your air conditioner at a higher\ntemperature\nTry to delay trips to the gas station and the use of household\nchemicals until the evening\n\nCheck air quality levels and take appropriate action as needed. When\nair quality index (AQI) levels are Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\n(orange), people with heart or lung disease, pregnant women,\nchildren, and older adults should limit prolonged or heavy outdoor\nexertion. When air quality reaches Unhealthy (red) AQI levels,\neveryone may experience adverse health effects and sensitive groups\nshould avoid prolonged time outdoors. At Very Unhealthy (purple) AQI\nlevels, sensitive groups should avoid all outdoor physical activity\nand everyone else should avoid prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion.\n\nTo view current and forecast air quality within Imperial County\nvisit the Imperial County Air Quality website at\nhttp://www.imperialvalleyair.org/ or follow ICAPCD on Twitter,\nfacebook or Instagram (@county_air).",

                "description": "* WHAT...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, one to two feet of\ninundation above ground level in low-lying areas near shorelines\nand tidal waterways. For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking\nwaves of 5 to 9 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards\nStatement, dangerous rip currents, large breaking waves, and\nstrong longshore currents in the surf zone.\n\n* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks and Hatteras Island.\n\n* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 9 AM EDT\nThursday. For the High Surf Advisory, until 9 PM EDT this\nevening. For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this\nevening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is\npossible in some areas near shorelines and tidal waterways\nresulting in an elevated threat of property damage. Flooding\nwill extend inland from the waterfront threatening some homes\nand businesses. Numerous road closures and flooding of vehicles\nwill be possible. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and\nlocalized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best\nswimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore\nbreak can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom\ncausing neck and back injuries. Strong longshore currents will\ncreate dangerous swimming conditions.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip\ncurrents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,\nwhich will occur around 12:15 PM Wednesday. Ocean overwash is\npossible around the times of high tide around 6 PM this evening.",
                "instruction": "If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be\nclosed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of\nunknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone\nproperty.\n\nInexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to\ndangerous surf conditions.\n\nLife-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain\ncalm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,\nfloat or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to\nescape, face the shore and call or wave for help.\n\nShore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is\nextremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you\nare in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at\nall times.\n\nStrong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip\ncurrents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many\ncases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers\nfrom being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it\ndifficult to return to shore.",

For the High Surf Advisory, large breaking\nwaves of 5 to 9 feet in the surf zone. For the Beach Hazards\nStatement, dangerous rip currents, large breaking waves, and\nstrong longshore currents in the surf zone.\n\n* WHERE...Northern Outer Banks and Hatteras Island.\n\n* WHEN...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, until 9 AM EDT\nThursday. For the High Surf Advisory, until 9 PM EDT this\nevening. For the Beach Hazards Statement, until 8 PM EDT this\nevening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Up to 1 to 2 feet of inundation above ground level is\npossible in some areas near shorelines and tidal waterways\nresulting in an elevated threat of property damage. Flooding\nwill extend inland from the waterfront threatening some homes\nand businesses. Numerous road closures and flooding of vehicles\nwill be possible. Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and\nlocalized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best\nswimmers away from shore into deeper water. Dangerous shore\nbreak can throw a swimmer or surfer head first into the bottom\ncausing neck and back injuries. Strong longshore currents will\ncreate dangerous swimming conditions.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The most likely time for strong rip\ncurrents to occur is a couple hours either side of low tide,\nwhich will occur around 12:15 PM Wednesday. Ocean overwash is\npossible around the times of high tide around 6 PM this evening.",
                "instruction": "If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be\nclosed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of\nunknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone\nproperty.\n\nInexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to\ndangerous surf conditions.\n\nLife-threatening rip currents. If caught in a rip current, remain\ncalm. Swim in a direction following the shoreline. If tired,\nfloat or tread water until out of the rip current. If unable to\nescape, face the shore and call or wave for help.\n\nShore break occurs when waves break directly on the beach. It is\nextremely important to protect your head and neck whenever you\nare in breaking waves by keeping your hands in front of you at\nall times.\n\nStrong longshore currents can sweep swimmers and surfers into rip\ncurrents, piers, jetties and other hazardous areas. In many\ncases, the longshore current is strong enough to prevent swimmers\nfrom being able to keep their feet on the bottom making it\ndifficult to return to shore.",
